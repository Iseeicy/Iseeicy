# Hello!
I'm Holly (from the nexus???). This is my personal GitHub - it's not super organized. If you're looking to connect with me on a more professional basis, check out [@hollyplankdev](https://github.com/hollyplankdev/).

# Notable Projects
## netengine5
This is what I'm currently working on! [netengine5](https://github.com/Iseeicy/netengine5) is a badly named framework / set of plugins for Godot that seek to recreate previous versions of tools that I have used in Unity3D projects. While ne5 itself is still pretty undocumented and messy, you can find example projects using it below:
